# How to contribute

We welcome contributions to this repo, but we do have a few guidelines for
contributors.

## Open an issue and pull request for changes

All submissions, including those from project memebers, are required to go through
review. We use GitHub Pull Requests for this workflow, which should be linked with
an issue for tracking purposes.
See [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more details.
