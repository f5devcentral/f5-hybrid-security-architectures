# FDX Controls Reference Implementation

## Overview

Example hybrid security deployments utilizing F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP in conjunction with the F5 product portfolio.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* [F5 Distributed Cloud Account (F5XC)](https://console.ves.volterra.io/signup/usage_plan)
  * [F5XC API certificate](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/user-mgmt/credentials)
* [NGINX Plus with App Protect license](https://www.nginx.com/free-trial-request/)
* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com) - Due to the assets being created, free tier will not work.
  * The F5 BIG-IP AMI being used from the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) must be applied to your account
* [Terraform Cloud Account](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started)
* [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

## Assets

* **xc:**        F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP
* **nap:**       NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes with NGINX App Protect (WAF and API Protection)
* **bigip:**     F5 BIG-IP (LTM and Advanced WAF)
* **infra:**     AWS Infrastructure (VPC, IGW, etc.)
* **eks:**       AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service
* **arcadia:**   Arcadia Finance test web application and API
* **juiceshop:** OWASP Juice Shop test web application

## Tools

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS
* **IAC:** Terraform
* **IAC State:** Terraform Cloud
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Terraform Cloud

* **Workspaces:** Create a CLI or API workspace for each asset in the workflow chosen

  | **Workflow** | **Assets/Workspaces**          |
  | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
  | xc-bigip    | infra, bigip, juiceshop, xc     |
  | xc-nap      | infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc    |
  | xc-nap-api  | infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc    |
  | xc-nap-bot  | infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc    |

* **Workspace Sharing:** Under the settings for each Workspace, set the **Remote state sharing** to share with each Workspace created.
  
* **Variable Set:** Create a Variable Set with the following values:

  | **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
  | ---------|----------|-----------------|
  | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Environment | Your AWS Access Key ID |
  | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | Environment | Your AWS Secret Access Key |
  | AWS_SESSION_TOKEN | Environment | Your AWS Session Token |
  | NGINX_JWT | Environment | Your NGINX JSON Web Token associated with your NGINX license. Set this to nginx-repo.jwt |
  | VOLT_API_P12_FILE | Environment | Your F5XC API certificate. Set this to api.p12 |
  | VES_P12_PASSWORD | Environment | Set this to the password you supplied when creating your F5 XC API certificate |
  | ssh_key | Terraform | Your ssh key for access to created BIG-IP and compute assets |
  | admin_src_addr | Terraform | The source address and subnet in CIDR format of your administrative workstation |
  | tf_cloud_organization | Terraform | Your Terraform Cloud Organization name |

## GitHub

* **Fork and Clone Repo**

* **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in your forked repo
  *  NGINX_JWT: The base64 encoded NGINX Java Web Token associated with your NGINX license
  *  P12: The base64 encoded F5XC API certificate
  *  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
  *  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization name
  *  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_*\<Workspace Name\>*: Create for each workspace in your workflow
      * EX: TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_BIGIP would be created with the value `bigip`
  *  GITHUB_TOKEN: Your GitHub Registry token 
  *  FDX_REGISTRY_TOKEN: The FDX GithHub Registry token, see FDX reference implementation deployment guide
  
## Workflow Runs

**STEP 1:** Check out a branch for the workflow you wish to run using the following naming convention

  **DEPLOY**
  
  | Workflow          | Branch Name       |
  |------------------ | ------------------|
  | xc-bigip | deploy-xc-bigip |
  | xc-nap | deploy-xc-nap |
 
  **DESTROY**
  
  | Workflow          | Branch Name       |
  |------------------ | ------------------|
  | xc-bigip | destroy-xc-bigip |
  | xc-nap | destroy-xc-nap |
  

**STEP 2:** Rename `infra/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `infra/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * project_prefix  = "Your project identifier - this will be applied as a prefix to all assets"
  * resource_owner = "You"
  * aws_region     = "AWS Region" ex. us-east-1
  * azs            = ["us-east-1a", "us-east1b"] - Change to Correct Availability Zones based on Region


**STEP 3:** Rename `bigip/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `bigip/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * f5_ami_search_name = "F5 BIGIP-16.1.3* PAYG-Adv WAF Plus 25Mbps*" - You must be subscribed to the AMI in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)
  * aws_secretmanager_auth = false
  * create_awaf_config = true
  * awaf_config_payload = "awaf-config.json"


**Step 3:** Rename `xc/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `xc/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * api_url         = "Your F5XC tenant"
  * xc_namespace    = "The XC namespace you are deploying to"
  * app_domain      = "the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)"
  * xc_waf_blocking = "Set to true to enable blocking"


**STEP 5:** Commit and push your build branch to your forked repo
  * Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF Cloud console


**STEP 6:** Once the pipeline completes, verify your assets were deployed or destroyed based on your workflow.  
            **NOTE:**  The autocert process takes time.  It may be 5 to 10 minutes before Let's Encrypt has provided the cert.
