# F5 Distributed Cloud Hybrid Security Architecture Deployments

## Overview

Examples of hybrid security deployments utilizing F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP in conjunction with the F5 product portfolio.  For more information on the project, please see the following article series [F5 Hybrid Security Architectures: One WAF Engine, Total Flexibility](https://community.f5.com/t5/technical-articles/f5-hybrid-security-architectures-one-waf-engine-total/ta-p/307248)

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

## GitHub

* **Fork and Clone Repo. Navigate to `Actions` tab and enable it.**

* **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in your forked repo
  *  P12: The linux base64 encoded F5XC API certificate
  *  NGINX_JWT: The linux base64 encoded NGINX Java Web Token value associated with your NGINX Ingress license
  *  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
  *  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization name
  *  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_*\<Workspace Name\>*: Create for each workspace in your workflow
      * EX: TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_BIGIP_BASE would be created with the value `bigip-base`

## Workflow Runs

**STEP 1:** Check out a branch for the workflow you wish to run using the following naming convention. 

  **DEPLOY**
  
  | Workflow     | Branch Name      |
  | ------------ | ---------------- |
  | xc-bigip     | deploy-xc-bigip  |
  | xc-nap       | deploy-xc-nap    |
  | xcapi-nic    | deploy-xcapi-nic |
  | xc-bigip+bot | deploy-xc-bigip  |
  | xcbn-cis     | deploy-xcbn-cis  |
 
  **DESTROY**
  
  | Workflow     | Branch Name       |
  | ------------ | ----------------- |
  | xc-bigip     | destroy-xc-bigip  |
  | xc-nap       | destroy-xc-nap    |
  | xcapi-nic    | destroy-xcapi-nic |
  | xc-bigip+bot | destroy-xc-bigip  |
  | xcbn-cis     | destroy-xcbn-cis  |


**STEP 2:** Rename `infra/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `infra/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * project_prefix  = "Your project identifier name in **lower case** letters only - this will be applied as a prefix to all assets"
  * resource_owner = "Your-name"
  * aws_region     = "AWS Region" ex. us-east-1
  * azs            = ["us-east-1a", "us-east1b"] - Change to Correct Availability Zones based on selected Region
  * Also update assets boolean value as per your work-flows


**STEP 3:** Depending on your work-flow, rename and update related .tfvars. For example in xc-bigip work-flow, update `bigip/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `bigip/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * f5_ami_search_name = "F5 BIGIP-16.1.3* PAYG-Adv WAF Plus 25Mbps*" - You must be subscribed to the AMI in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)
  * aws_secretmanager_auth = false
  * create_awaf_config = true
  * awaf_config_payload = "awaf-config.json"


**Step 3:** Rename `xc/terraform.tfvars.examples` to `xc/terraform.tfvars` and add the following data:
  * api_url         = "Your F5XC tenant"
  * xc_tenant       = "Your tenant id available in F5 XC `Administration` section `Tenant Overview` menu"
  * xc_namespace    = "The existing XC namespace where you want to deploy resources"
  * app_domain      = "the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)"
  * xc_waf_blocking = "Set to true to enable blocking"
  * Also update assets boolean value as per your work-flow based on the values in the tfvars example.

**STEP 5:** Commit and push your build branch to your forked repo
  * Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF Cloud console


**STEP 6:** Once the pipeline completes, verify your assets were deployed or destroyed based on your workflow. From F5 XC console, you can check if the F5 XC load balancer has come to active.
            **NOTE:**  The autocert process takes time.  It may be 5 to 10 minutes before Let's Encrypt has provided the cert.
